Particle output
----------------

For particle-based species, we can simply write all information
about each particle at some instant to disk.
Particle information includes positions, velocities,
indices of the elements containing the particles,
charge numbers, *etc*.
Since simulations may have many particles,
this is extremely slow, and should not be done often.
